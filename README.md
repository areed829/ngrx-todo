# To Do App
### This project is meant to demonstrate how to build a to-do app using three different patterns.
---
Install dependencies before running the app:
```
npm install
```
To start the app run: 

```
npx ng serve
```
Then navigate to localhost:4200. There you will see a menu with the three options to see the project running in all the different ways.

## TO-DO

This implementation uses component state and properties to manage the to-do list. It's state is completely maintained by the component, and the properties are passed down to the child components.

## TO-DO-RXJS

This implementation utilizes RxJS to manage the to-do list. It uses more reactive programming techniques to manage the state. 

## TO-DO-NGRX

This implementation utilizes NGRX to manage the to-do list. This relies entirely on reactive programming techniques.
